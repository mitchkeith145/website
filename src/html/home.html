                                    I'm a 25 year old software engineer from Northeast Ohio. After graduating college, I moved to Chicago and began working for Morningstar. It's wild how quickly you're able to fall into the routine, and wilder still how much quicker the time flies once you're in that routine. Two years came and went, and I felt the need to move on. I wanted to move, to shake things up. But, instead of moving straight to a new job, I decided to do something. I decided that after leaving Morningstar, I was going to travel. I was going to hit the road in my car and drive it all over. I wanted to hike up mountains and camp beneath the stars; I wanted to see a lifetime's worth of National Parks in a few months. I wanted to live an adventure, to slow time down, to make every day of my life a little bit different than the one previous. I knew that leaving a good job in a good city to live out of a car for a few months might not be the smartest choice I could make, with regard to hitting all my retirement goals and securing long term financial security for me and my hypothetical family of the future. I knew that gaps in employment do not look favorable to potential employers. Yet I knew that once the synapses fired and that idea -- that idea to travel and explore and live minimally but vividly -- was born, that I was going to follow this gut feeling to its end. Fast forward several months and I'd spent 100 days on the road, traveling through 27 U.S. states and 3 Canadian Provinces. I camped and hiked at 37 U.S. National Parks and 3 Canadian ones. I drove nearly 23,000 miles. I did most of it alone.

                                    And now I'm done with my detour. I have spent the time since my return from the road getting reaquainted with my craft. I created this website using React + NodeJS.
